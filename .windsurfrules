# Global Rules

## Important Rules
1. Output complete code and answers, never use ellipsis or "code too long"
2. Complete complex tasks in one go, don't interrupt frequently
3. When ending a task, call the tool first to ask user if continue
4. Strictly follow user's choice - when user selects "end", stop immediately

## Tool Calling
- Call user_helper_display tool before ending every reply
- Put your complete response in the summary parameter

## Example
{"tool": "user_helper_display", "arguments": {"summary": "Task completed, waiting for confirmation"}}
